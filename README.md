Advent Of Code solutions

# Folder Structure
All solutions are in the folder structure Year/Language/Day.

# Other
The possibility for multiple languages is here so setup is as follows

## F#
Language need dotnet SDK. To run these files, cd into the directory `cd 2021/F#/day-xx` and run `dotnet fsi FILENAME.fsx`. Solution will print out the answers to the actual puzzle (using my input) and tests will show what tests were used to ensure functions were correct (samples from website).

## Dart
The Dart SDK will need to be installed from [the dart lang website](https://dart.dev/get-dart). Once the SDK is installed, you can cd into the folder for the project `cd 2021/Dart/day-xx` and running `dart run`.

Please be aware these were made secondary and are not as well structured. I will try to clean up all programs to output the same outputrs for tests and solutions over time.

## Go
You can download the golang SDK from [the golang website](https://go.dev/). The folder contains a main.go file which will run all sub-days and there are tests for each daybased on the examples. When in the folder with main.go, you can run he command `go run main.go` to run the project. I have written these using VS Code and so setup is for that, apologies if you use goland or another IDE

## Editors
Helix - In 2023 i used the helix editor to try and learn something new, while slowing me down i'm using it as a experience to learn a new editor instead of a new language this year.
